# chat-gpt-reddit-bot

Experimental reddit bot that responds to reddit summons with response generated by
OpenAI's [text completion](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/completion) endpoint.

To use, simply make a comment that mentions the username `u/ask-chat-gpt`. Everything after the mention will be
used for the prompt.

> ℹ️ **Disclaimers**:
> * This is not the same as ChatGPT, but once support is available in dependencies I might look to migrate
> * The bot may not always be available so replies may be delayed

## Development

This is a pretty standard .NET 7 project, and can be built from command line if you have the [.NET 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0)
installed - `dotnet build`.

You can also use Docker, or an IDE like Visual Studio Community.

Setup the reddit bot info and OpenAI token using [the SDK's secrets manager tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=windows#how-the-secret-manager-tool-works).
Here is a JSON example of the required settings:

```json
{
    "Reddit": {
        "AppId": "<appId>",
        "AppSecret": "<appSecret>",
        "RefreshToken": "<refreshToken>"
    },
    "OpenAIServiceOptions": {
        "ApiKey": "<apiKey>"
    }
}
```

When running under docker, the path to a JSON file that contains this config can
be supplied using the `DOTNET_CONFIGPATH` environment variable.
